### Improvements that I have implemented in this repo
1. Accessibility & keyboarding:
   * Provide focus outlines, aria-live regions for new chat messages, and keyboard shortcuts (e.g., / to jump to search, Ctrl+Enter to send). Also ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG.
   * Added an Escape key listener that’s only active when the chat is open, so pressing Esc closes the chatbot instantly without reaching for the mouse
1. Search UX polish:
   * Add debounce to reduce re-renders on every keystroke


### A few more ideas, roughly in order of impact:

1. Expandable data model: Right now the two pages are hard-coded. Move page content to a CMS or JSON fetched on load so product folks can add categories without touching code, and show a graceful loading/error state.
1. Search UX polish: show match counts, and keep filters per page instead of clearing when switching tabs.
   * For large payloads, consider Web Workers or server-backed search.
1. Chatbot fidelity: Persist conversation to localStorage/session so a refresh doesn’t erase history, display timestamps/avatars, and add typing indicators. Hook up to a simple backend endpoint if you want more realistic replies.
1. Testing & quality gates: Introduce unit tests (React Testing Library) for context logic and the chatbot hook, plus Playwright/Cypress smoke tests to catch regressions around search highlighting and chat interactions. // TODO
1. Performance & bundle health: Split the chatbot into a lazy-loaded chunk and run Lighthouse/React Profiler to check hydration and CPU use on low-end devices; add ESLint/Prettier hooks to keep the codebase tidy. // TODO
